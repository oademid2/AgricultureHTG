# GEWEEK

This repo is a Hackathon Project. It is a prototype of an app created for small scale kenyan farmers. It pulls inforfmation from different sources and uses that to create easy to understand metrics that allows small scale farmers to price better and gain more profits in the distribution channel.

This protype includes:
- Mainly the front end/back end mock up of viewing the metrics, weather insights and marketplace (Angular/Node.js)
- Connection to two different weather APIS
- Webscraping argiculture commodity sites for prcing indicators (Python/Flask)

Although this is designed as an app (kenyan farmers have a higher propesnity to tech than others existing in eastern africa and there is large efforts of internet accesibility in rural kenya), it is also acknowledged that an app is not the most accessible means. Hopefully as I continue to update this i can implement it as an sms functionality that would be more accesible.
